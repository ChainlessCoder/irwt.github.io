I was born in Switzerland, grew up in Kosovo, and did my studies in the Czech Republic and Austria. I am currently pursuing my masterâ€™s in Artificial Intelligence at the Johannes Kepler University (JKU), with a special focus on few-shot learning & viewpoint invariance. I have a bachelor's degree in bioinformatics with a specialization in machine learning, from both the University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice, and the JKU in Linz. Besides my studies, I am also the co-founder of [Bloom Lab](https://bloomlab.io), where I try to design new algorithms and data structures for decentralized systems. My papers can be viewed on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Ramabaja%2C+L).
