I was born in Switzerland, grew up in Kosovo, and did my studies in the Czech Republic and Austria. I have a bachelor's degree in bioinformatics from both the the University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice, and the Johannes Kepler University in Linz. I am currently pursuing a master's in artificial intelligence at the Johannes Kepler University. Besides my studies, I am also the Chief Scientist at [Bloom Lab](https://bloomlab.io). My papers can be viewed on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Ramabaja%2C+L).
