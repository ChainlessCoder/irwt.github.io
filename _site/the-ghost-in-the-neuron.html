<hr />
<p>In this chapter, we will focus on two topics. In the first part, I will lay down the necessary puzzle pieces required to understand how memory is formed and stored in neural circuits. We will take a closer look at the morphology of various neurons, as well as question the purpose of certain neural structures. In the second part of the chapter, we will investigate the enigmatic process known as “coincidence detection”, i.e. the ability of neurons to specialize to certain inputs. Before diving straight to the interesting bits however, it is important to establish a common language. It wouldn’t make much sense to try and figure out how an engine works, without first knowing its parts. The first step towards reverse engineering the algorithms that give rise to engrams, is to understand how the underlying hardware works.</p>

<p>In schools, we are usually taught that a neuron takes in signals sent from other neurons. It then integrates the received signals, and if the integrated inputs exceed a certain threshold, the neuron fires a signal to other neurons. This is also known as the integrate and fire model. If you still remember this fact from a biology class, I want you to forget it. One of the most difficult things for people who have finished an education, is to unlearn the idea that “the way we model the world, represents the way the world is”. Only after realizing that <em>all</em> human models are wrong, can we overcome our biases to come up with completely new ideas. We are often taught to imagine neurons as thin branching wires that simply integrate incoming signals and fire. I argue that treating neurons as such a simplistic systems can often do more harm than good. A single neuron is in fact unbelievably complex. My goal in this chapter, besides laying down the necessary puzzle pieces for later chapters, is to convince you to look at neurons with a different light. Instead of imagining neurons as simple logic gates, you will (hopefully) look at them as unbelievably powerful computers.</p>

<p>Neurons are not only complex, but diverse as well. We usually talk about neurons, as if there was only one type of neuron, but that is far from correct. There is, in fact, a whole jungle of different neurons in your brain, each possessing different abilities and morphology. Some neurons, like the <em>interneurons</em> shut down, or <em>inhibit</em> other neurons when sending signals to them. Some other neurons might have the opposite effect and turn on, or <em>excite</em> other neurons. Even though there are many different kinds of neurons, we nonetheless refer to them all with the shared name “neurons”, due to their similar electrical properties. They all are able to accept and send signals to other neurons. Every neuron has a cell body, or <em>soma</em>, as any other cell. The soma houses the genome of the neuron, most of the gene expression happens at this part of the cell. It also houses a variety of organelles, small biological machines floating in the fluid of the soma. From the soma, a long fiber like structure emerges, called the <em>axon</em>. The axon is where a neuron initiates action potentials, aka spikes, aka signals (more exactly at a part of the axon called the axon hillock). Once we go along the axon, it further splits into many branches, at the end of which there are <em>axon terminals</em>. Axon terminals are the parts of the axon that actually connect to other neurons. The axon thus serves as the “output pole” for the neuron, this means that it transmits signals to other neurons by firing spikes through the axon, to the axon terminals, and that way to other neurons.</p>

<p>Beside the axon, there are also many other branching fibers that come out of the soma, also known as <em>dendrites</em>. If we imagine axons as the output pole of a neuron, then the dendrites are its “input pole”, in other words they receive the signals sent from other neurons. So the dendrites accept signals from other neurons, whereas the axon transmits signals to other neurons, and both are connected to the cell body, aka the soma. As in any living thing, all the mentioned parts of the neuron are covered by a cell membrane, also known as a lipid bilayer. Because of it, the inside of the neuron has a different resting potential, than the outside of the neuron. The electrochemical properties, and mechanisms of how the membrane achieves such a contrast is well beyond this book. For now just take into consideration that a neuron’s membrane is covered with proteins that serve as gates to the outside world. These proteins are often referred in the literature as pumps, or channels, depending on their properties. The inside of a neuron, as well as the fluid surrounding the neurons, contains various ions, such as Cl-, Na+, K+, Ca2+. The proteins residing inside the lipid bilayer act as gates, allowing some of the ions to flow inside the neuron, and pump other ions out of the neuron, depending on conditions. This causes the inside of the neuron to have a different charge from the outside fluid.</p>

<p>When a neuron’s dendrites are stimulated by a neuron that is emitting spikes, aka by a <em>pre-synaptic</em> neuron, it causes some of the channels from the neuron that is receiving the spikes, aka the <em>post-synaptic</em> neuron , to quickly open, allowing some ions to rapidly flow into the cell, further increasing the positive charge of the neuron. This simple process can result in a chain reaction of events, creating a wave of ions that travel rapidly along the axon, and trough its axon terminals along its way. This wave is also known as an action potential, or a spike. In other words, action potentials are the signals that get transmitted from one neuron, to another. The axon terminals of a neuron are very close (but do not touch) to the dendrites or somas of other neurons. The small region where an axon terminal “connects” to another neuron is called a <em>synapse</em>, and the narrow gap between the two neurons is also known as the <em>synapatic cleft</em>. Imagine it as a tiny space between the axon terminal of one neuron, and the dendrite of another neuron. The previously mentioned action potentials, after reaching the axon terminal cause the axon terminals to release chemicals (also known as <em>neurotransmitters</em>) to the synaptic cleft. The released neurotransmitters can result in the opening of ion channels at the post-synaptic neuron. This procedure is also known as <em>chemical transmission</em>, and it’s the main mechanism for how neurons communicate with one another.</p>

<p>As a recap, neurons get signals from other neurons via their dendrites, long fibre looking structures that come out of the soma (the cell body). The signals flow from the dendrites to the soma, where they are somehow integrated, and then a signal gets fired through the axon, which reaches the other neurons via the axon terminals. This is a very simplistic depiction of how information flows from one neuron to another. So in a nutshell, the terms you have to remember and understand before being able to continue are: soma, axon, dendrites, synapse, synaptic cleft, neurotransmitters, pre-synaptic neuron, post-synaptic neuron, and the basic idea of excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons. Now that the terminology is cleared, we can go on with the actual chapter.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, there are many different kinds of neurons in the brain. One of the most notable ones is the pyramidal neuron, which was first discovered and extensively studied by Santiago Ramón y Cajal back in the 19th century. It is the most common type of excitatory neuron in the mammalian cortical structures, as well as one among the largest neurons in the brain. It is also believed that they play an important role in advanced cognitive functions. One can find pyramidal cells in different brain parts, such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, each of which plays a key role in memory (as well as many other functions). Every single mammal has pyramidal neurons, but it is not only mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles also poses them. The fact that we can find pyramidal neurons across many distant species is quite intriguing.</p>

<p>Besides its wide occurrence in nature, the pyramidal neuron also has some interesting morphological characteristics. Both its dendrites and axon seem to be branched extensively, which allows it to communicate with thousands of other distant neurons. Like other kinds of neurons, the pyramidal neuron has many branching dendrites that come out of the soma, also known as <em>basal dendrites</em>. Besides the basal dendrites however, there is also another, single, long, dendrite that emerges from its soma. This long dendrite is also known as the <em>apical dendrite</em>, and it can extend for several hundred microns before branching into many smaller dendrites. The cluster of branches at the end of an apical dendrite is also known as the <em>apical tuft</em>. Synaptic information flows from the apical tuft, through the body of the apical dendrite, all the way to the soma. The soma thus receives the signals from several places, its apical dendrite and its basal dendrites, and then “decides” if it should fire or not. We <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8743416/">know</a> for example that the shorter basal dendrites receive their input from local pyramidal cells and interneurons, whereas the long apical dendrite receives its inputs from more distant regions.</p>

</p>

<p>Why would pyramidal neurons posses such a long dendrite? Some researchers believe that it’s more energy efficient for a neuron to have one long dendrite with lots of branches at the end, than many long dendrites. This certainly makes sense, but could there also be another reason? There are for example other types of neurons, like the stellate cells, that do not have an apical dendrite at all. But we also know that most stellate cells are inhibitory in nature, whereas the Pyramidal neuron with its apical dendrite is excitatory. Why would some neurons posses apical dendrites, whereas some others not? Understanding the role of the apical dendrite will be our first puzzle piece. Once we realize that we’re dealing with an asynchronous system, the existence for an apical dendrite starts to make more sense. For now just keep in mind that this interesting feature exists, we will get back to it in the next chapter again.</p>

<p>Another fascinating and mind boggling structure of the pyramidal neuron, is the so called dendritic spine, which was also discovered and thoroughly studied by Santiago Ramón y Cajal. Dendritic spines are tiny protrusions that completely cover the apical dendrites and basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons. When looked under a microscope, we can see the spines cover the whole dendrites, much like leaves on a tree. Cajal named them ‘‘dendritic spines’’, because when he studied them, they looked like spines on a rose stem (even though now we know that dendritic spines are more round and not really spiny in shape). Today we know that dendriditc spines are where most synapses form. But even back then, Cajal speculated that spines were the part of the neuron that received axonal inputs from other neurons. If you remember from earlier on, that is in fact the definition of a synapse. He also had another interesting <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/dendritic-spines">thought</a> about spines: Cajal believed that physical changes in dendritic spines could somehow be associated with learning. Today, the overwhelming evidence shows that this is indeed the case.</p>

<p>Dendritic spines are in fact the</p>

<p>There can be various stages, or classes of dendritic spines, the exact category borders of which are a bit blurry. In general we classify spines into thin, stubby, and mushroom spines. Thin spines have a small head and a long neck that connects to the parental dendrite. Stubby spines have no neck at all and are more expressed in infants. Whereas mushroom spines have a wide neck with a large head and are more expressed in adult brains \citet{Yuste2010DendriticSpines}.</p>

<p>They were first discovered and named by Santiago Ram'on y Cajal when observing the surface of Purkinje cells, which are another type of neurons that are studded with dendritic spines.</p>

<p>It is believed that dendritic spines somehow serve as information storage components. Indeed, there are a lot of puzzling facts about the dendritic spine once you study it. First, it is now clear that spines receive most of the excitatory input in neurons \citet{Yuste2010DendriticSpines}. Remember when I described synapses in the previous chapter? Practically all the excitatory synapses a neuron has, form on dendritic spines \citet{Yuste2010DendriticSpines}. In other words excitatory axons prefer for some reason to terminate particularly on spines, they almost never connect directly to dendritic shafts (i.e. the body of the dendrite). Why is this the case? Does it really matter that much where a signal enters a dendrite?</p>

<p>To make things even stranger, we can see the opposite behavior in inhibitory axons. Inhibitory axons almost always connect directly to dendritic shafts, rather than on spines \citet{Yuste2010DendriticSpines}. ‘‘This can’t be a coinsidence’’ you might think, and I’d argue that you’re right. When we start to zoom a bit out from the spine and focus on the neuron as a whole, we can observe another strange fact: Excitatory neurons like the Pyramidal neuron all have dendritic spines. Whereas inhibitory neurons, like the internerons which we will talk about in a bit, are most of the time spineless \citet{Yuste2010DendriticSpines}.</p>

<p>Why would axon terminals prefer different sites depending on their signaling nature? Why are so many neurons covered in spines, while some others barely have them? Could there be an epiphenomenon at play here? The presence of dendritic spines, or the lack of them, is our next puzzle piece for the Koha model. For now, let’s jsut keep these facts in mind.</p>

<p>A neuron can be studded with hundreds of thousands of dendritic spines. As many scientists before me, I also argue that dendritic spines are in fact computational units that serve as memory storage. Even Cajal who discovered dendritic spines a century ago, argued that physical changes in spines could be associated with learning. Many scientists believe that spines serve as storage sites for synaptic strength (a term we will explore in later chapters). I believe however that spines serve a much bigger role than just that.</p>

<p>Nowadays we know from imaging experiments that dendritic spines are indeed biochemical compartments, more specifically calcium compartments \citet{Yuste1995DendriticIntegration.}. The narrow neck of the spine can create an isolated compartment in which the biochemical signals of the spine head do not spread along the parent dendrite \citet{Volfovsky1999GeometryExperiments}. To some readers this might sound like a boring biology fact, but the implications of it are enormous. Many scientists think that because of the compartmentalized nature of spines, they could potentially act as functional units inside dendrites. In layman terms, spines could be responsible for determining how incoming signals are integrated.</p>

<p>There are now many experiments that support this claim. We now know for example that the most significant filtering of local potentials does not happen along the dendrite, but instead at the spine neck \citet{Araya2006ThePotentials}. The spine neck is somehow able to modulate the amplitude of incoming signals. Further studies have also shown that spines, additionally to filtering out local potentials, are also able to amplify them \citet{Araya2007SodiumPotentials.}. How does a spine know what kind of modulation to apply to local potentials?</p>

<p>Interestingly, spines in pyramidal neurons are full with some receptors known as NMDA receptors. These receptors are quite slow compared to other excitatory receptors. Because of this (and some other studies), some scientist like Rafael Yuste for example, believe that one thing spines do, is slow down the synaptic inputs a neuron receives. But why would a neuron want to slow down its inputs? One would assume that evolution would have optimized neurons for speed, having faster reaction times is after all an important feature. That is not what we see however. But instead of thinking things like ‘‘What a poorly designed machinary’’, we should think ‘‘hmm, what could be so important, that slowing down signals could become advantageous?’’. The pyramidal neuron after all has passed the test of time.</p>

<p>With all the strange facts we collected so far, I would like to propose something even stranger. I propose the existence of a Spinal code. We will discuss about potential candidates for the physical manifestation of the code in the next chapter. For now, just imagine that each dendritic spine has a fingerprint which allows it to detect a specific temporal pattern in its input stream. As looney as the proposal might sound, things will make sense in the next chapter. The strange apical dendrite of the pyramidal neuron, the presence or absence of dendritic spines in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, the strange preference of axon terminals to connect to dendritic sites depending on their signaling nature, the ability of spines to dynamically modulate local potentials, all this and more will start to make sense by introducing the existence of a spinal code. However, as Richard Feynman once said:
\begin{displayquote}
‘‘It doesn’t matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. If it doesn’t agree with experiment, it’s wrong.’’
\end{displayquote}
As I claimed earlier, I tried to be as strict as possible to the model’s biological plausibility. The existence of a Spinal code, even though purely hypothetical, will start to sound plausible,  after we explore the interesting facts of the next chapter.</p>
